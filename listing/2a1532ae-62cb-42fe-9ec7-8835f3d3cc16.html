            <h3>About the Server</h3>
            <p>In the beginning, Comfy was just a server I set up for a friend. 

It was quite humble, just a few guys playing through the game together, hosted on my home computer.

I decided to put the server on a dedicated box so we could all play at odd hours and something amazing happened. We just started growing day by day with people inviting their friends and sharing us around Facebook and elsewhere. 

The rest is history. Comfy has grown to be the largest server in the world with a dedicated game master team, development team, and moderation staff.

We like to keep things &quot;comfy&quot;. That means befriending and helping out new players, and consoling our long-timers through hardships. In the game, and beyond.

When you join Comfy, you&#x27;re joining more than just a gaming community.

Read our blog!: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.comfyblog.valheimlist.org&#x2F;</p>
            

            
            <h3>About the Staff</h3>
            <p>Comfy is operated by Saurek, who is also the creator of Valheimlist.org.

We have multiple high profile software engineers on our staff, such as Redseiko, and many of our server&#x27;s mods are completely custom, written by the team.

The game master and moderator team is picked from highly involved community members.</p>

I had already given up on Valheim, after all my Friends stopped playing. Looking for some new Battlebrothers and Sisters I found Comfy-Valheim. The Server is all I ever wanted, a populated World, friendly Players, a welcoming Atmosphere, Custom Events, Dungeon Raids, Jumping Puzzles etc and a great Stuff Team! I was so impressed by this server and how much fun I had playing on it that I even started covering it on my Youtube Channel!

Long Live Comfy!">

In the server they have a &quot;Bard&#x27;s guild&quot; where people actually sing on the mic in the Discord. I thought it would be somewhat awkward, but then I heard Anathema sing and it absolutely blew my mind. It was a legitimate performance...

This server is something special. I&#x27;ll cherish the gaming memories I&#x27;ve had here for a long long time.

                        Comfy has a great staff, fun events, and incredible builds. 100% is going to be my go-to as the game progresses. It reminds me a lot of the nerd.nu mi

It was amazing to see the world was 500 days old at opening. It shows the level of work and preparation. I&#x27;ve been a part of some great servers and some shit ones.

I&#x27;ve bounced around a number of places looking to play online and Comfy has one of the most active communities around.

The admins are responsive and fair and the work they put in to crafting an experience is obvious.

There are a lot of mods the server uses, but the game experience is still mostly vanilla. The economy is one of the most robust with a lot of interesting opportunities for player interaction.

It&#x27;s definitely worth checking out at least.">

 <h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>Valheimlist.org is a non-profit website run by Saurek. It collects the minimum amount of information required to operate.
</p>
<p>When you login using Discord's Oauth2 system, Discord provides us with your account name, account token, and user ID. When you de-authenticate Valheimlist.org that information is wiped after 1 week.</p>
<p>We do not store any query data from your Discord account. Any data received from Discord only lives in our system for as long as that request was processing, usually under 1 millisecond. The Discord information you see on pages, such as profile pictures, is not stored on our server. A secure connection is made between your web browser and Discord's servers to display that.</p>
